## Plot PCA

Following scripts 01 and 02, use 03 to plot PCA's interactively or statically.

### All Samples

Includes 888 samples, not balanced.


```r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))

# sftp in and cd projects/rangewide/pop_gen/results_pca
# get get ncoast_rabo*covMat

# source the function to plot
source(paste0(here(),"/scripts/functions/f_read_covar_rangewide.R"))

# load the metadata
metadat <- read_csv(file = paste0(here(), "/data/rapture_metadata_rabo.csv"))

# set site/reads for bamlist/covar filepaths:
reads <- "25k"
site <- "all_rabo"
covarpath<- paste0(here(), "/data_output/pca/", site, "_", reads,".covMat")
bampath <- paste0(here(), "/data_output/bamlists/", site, "_", reads, "_thresh.bamlist")

# run function
## Specify the colvar as any of the following: Pop (River), Locality, HU_12_NAME, etc
## Specify the shapevar as any of the following: ecoreg, HUC6, HU_8_NAME, 
(read_covar(covarpath, bampath, metadat, c(1,2), "ecoreg", "ecoreg", plotlyplot = TRUE))

**Notes**

There are a number of outliers, future PCA should probably not include these (or we should double check):

 - **RAP-092** S. Coast, Dry-Cantua_AL, in middle nearest Sierras
 - **RAP-104** N Coast, Mad, Redwood Ck 2, oriented with North Coast  but on outskirts.
 - **RAP-122** Sierras, SFY-Spring Creek, clusters with N Coast, I suspect it's mis-labeled
 - **RAP-226** N Coast, Smith, aggregated towards feather, in middle
 - **RAP-278** Sierras, Bear-Missouri Canyon, in middle of all samples
 - **RAP-335** N. Coast, SF Eel Elder, aggregates closest to NFF Poe samples
 - **RAP-346** Sierras, NFA-Shirttail
 - **RAP-347** Sierras, CAL-Esperanza Creek, near the S. Coast samples
 - **RAP-348** Sierras, NFA- in middle of all samples
 - **RAP-1649** Sierras, MF Feather, in ballpark of NFFeather samples, but definitely diff than all NFF 
 - The two PIT samples aggregated with the Sierra Nevada Samples, nearest the Yubas, not sure about these labeling/location wise so should probably drop?
 - NFF Samples are definitely different than all other samples in NF Feather basin...significantly.
 - All Dry Creek Samples are odd, they seem to be oriented toward the North Coast samples more than the S/Central Coast (see RAP-213, RAP-215, RAP-083).



### All Samples: Filt01

Remove outliers and rerun...still includes 879 samples and not equally balanced.

A few notes:

 - The **SMITH-HurdyGurdy** seems to parse out differently from all other pops in the north coast, along with 
 - The **MAD-RedwoodCreek**
 - **RAP-109**: Gual: SF Gualala-Salmon, cluster with Mad and Trinity
 - **RAP-111**: On Mad river is different from other Mad samples on PCA.
 - **RAP-229**: Also seems to be an outlier compared to other points in SF Trinity Cluster
 - **RAP-321**: Seems to be an outlier that sits between the Smith and other pops
 - **RAP-344, RAP-335**: SF Eel Elder, seem a bit odd but cluster with Mad and Trinity samples
 - **RAP1418**: Also seems to be an outlier compared to other points within SMITH-HurdyGurdy Creek Cluster
 
 - The **Klamath** samples definitely cluster slightly closer to the SMITH samples than any of the other rivers (including MAD, MAT VanDUZ, SF Eel, Tinity)
